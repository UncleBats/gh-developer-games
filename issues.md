1. The URL in the repository description and README are not there or are pointing to ps-developers-sandbox's copy of the game instead of yours.
Please fix both, so they point to your copy of the game at https://<HANDLE>/gh-developer-games.

1. When attempting to access this at https://<HANDLE>/gh-developer-games, I am getting a 404. This could be caused by a couple of things:
GitHub Pages needs to be enabled on the branch. You can fix this in the repository settings.
The index.html file is incorrectly named inde.html. We will fix this together in class.
Can you fix the first bullet, please?
